# Fighter-Jet-2D-game
Create with python/pygame module
I want to improve this game
there are some problems in this code such as,
the fighter_jet moves on both X and Y coordinate
and the fighter_jet fires missile from it's position
at this point that I've coded I think it is not suitable code for fire missile
so I've to improve it
and when fighter_jet gets collision with enemy_jet,the screen shows "Game Over" text at middle of the screen because the game is showing screen on while loop
at the initial point while loop = true but I've set while loop = false when fighter_jet gets collision with enemy_jet
this not the right way
So I want to improve this
I want add some levels and some kind of bosses to make more fun as well as
so If possible take a look on the code and contribute to develop the game
